## Question
>Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](files/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0_2_aab3d2a22456675a9f9c29783b256a3d on the shell server. [Source](files/vuln.c). 

### Hint
>How can you trigger the flag to print?
>
>If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

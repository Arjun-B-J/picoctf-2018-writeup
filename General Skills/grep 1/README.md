## Question
>Can you find the flag in [file](files/file)? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_3_8d9cff3d178c231ab735dfef3267a1c2 on the shell server. 

### Hint
>grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

## Solution
Do `cat file | grep picoCTF` to filter out the flag.

### Flag
`picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_cdf2e7c2}`
